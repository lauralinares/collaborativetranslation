Dear friends,

We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to you because one of our clients has requested the translation of three documents into the following languages:

- French
- Spanish
- Italian
- German
- Chinese

It is an urgent project, so we would need to know if it can go ahead before 11am this morning, and we would need the translation finished for 3:30pm today. Could you please reply as soon as possible with information about your availability for each language (partial or total), and a budget for the following:

- Translation
- Proofreading 
- Formatting

Please find the files here:

Also, could we please ask you that you send us the name of your point of contact so that we can be updated about the project and can answer queries if they arise? What is the easiest way to communicate with your team?


Many thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
**The BY&Partners Team**
