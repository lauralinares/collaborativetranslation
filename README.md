Dear Aileen,

Many thanks for your quick response and your availability to collaborate in this project. We would love to have as much text translated today as possible, but we fully understand that the urgency of the project might not allow it. All texts are equally relevant so we are happy to follow your recommendation for Italian, Chinese and German. If there are any changes in availability, we would please ask you to let us know as soon as possible.

The texts will be used for publication, so we would need full quality control and the utmost quality in the translation, please.

Many thanks again,

BY&Partners.

Dear Laura and Hannah,

Thank you for your translation proposal, and for giving us the opportunity to perform this work. I acknowledge receipt of 3 files for translation, which we have reviewed.  They are comprehensive documents and will require attention during translation. We find that
 a machine translation or translation memory will not assist in the translation, and that a human translation will be necessary.  




We have comprehensive language skills in the five languages including native speakers who are ready to translate today. However, we have full resources available for Spanish and French to perform the task and translate three articles fully, but partial resources
 who will be able to translate two of the three articles in Italian, Chinese, and German. Do you have any preference for which articles they should translate today? We would suggest the two shorter articles for Italian, and the longer Dorothy Price article
 and one of the two shorter articles for German and Chinese.




We are currently working on our pricing for this translation job. What level of translation is needed for this project today - full quality control or light review?


Thank you for your help,

Regards,
Aileen

Dear friends,

We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to you because one of our clients has requested the translation of three documents into the following languages:

- French
- Spanish
- Italian
- German
- Chinese

This is an urgent project, so **we would need to know if it can go ahead before 11am this morning**, and we would need the **translation finished for 3pm today**. Could you please reply as soon as possible with information about your availability for each language (partial or total), and a final price (including translation, proofreading and formatting).

Please find the files here:

Also, could we please ask you that you send us the name of your point of contact so that we can be updated about the project and can answer queries if they arise? What is the easiest way to communicate with your team?


Many thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
